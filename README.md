## Abstract
As more people learn about the world through reading links shared on social media plat- forms, the task of being able to identify hyper- partisan news becomes crucial for the vital- ity of an educated populous. Too, being able to interpret the classification models is impor- tant for robustness: in a world where speech is mediated by corporations, integrity and trans- parency around censored content is crucial. In this paper we describe a multi-feature ensem- ble for hyperpartisan news classification using a Temporal Convolution Network. Addition- ally we propose a bootstrapping technique for adjusting data that has been classified solely on the basis of publishing company, enabling one to leverage a practical combination of hu- man intuition and aggregated insight.
