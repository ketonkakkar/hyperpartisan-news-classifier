## Abstract
As more people learn about the world through reading links shared on social media platforms, the task of being able to identify hyperpartisan news becomes crucial for the vitality of an educated populous. In addition, being able to interpret the classification models is important for robustness: in a world where speech is mediated by corporations, integrity and trans- parency around censored content is crucial. In this paper we describe a multi-feature ensemble for hyperpartisan news classification using a Temporal Convolution Network. Additionally we propose a bootstrapping technique for adjusting data that has been classified solely on the basis of publishing company, enabling one to leverage a practical combination of hu- man intuition and aggregated insight.
